## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Teal (#008080). It is a calming, sophisticated color reminiscent of travel and stability, and offers a fresh take that avoids the overused blues often associated with marketplace apps.
- Background color: Light Gray (#F0F8FF). A near-white provides a neutral backdrop that keeps the focus on the hostel listings and does not detract from the visual impact of the deep teal.
- Accent color: Coral (#FF7F50). It offers a vibrant contrast to the deep teal, drawing attention to key interactive elements like booking buttons and call-to-actions, suggesting warmth and value.
- Font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif font that looks modern but with warmth and personality. This choice fits well in an educational or community context.
- Use clean and modern line icons to represent amenities and features, ensuring they are easily recognizable and intuitive. Icons should complement the overall minimalist design and add a touch of sophistication.
- Implement a grid-based layout for hostel listings to maintain a clean and organized presentation. Prioritize clear visual hierarchy and ensure easy navigation, focusing on usability for a young student audience.
- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions to enhance the user experience. For example, use smooth scrolling effects and gentle fades when loading new content. The intention is to make the app feel more dynamic and engaging, without distracting users from the core functionality.
